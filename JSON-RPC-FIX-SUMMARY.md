# JSON-RPC Fix Applied to MCP Knowledge Server

## Problem Identified
The MCP Knowledge Server was sending malformed JSON-RPC responses that included extra fields that shouldn't be present in response messages.

### Error Log Analysis
```
Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'method', 'params', 'error'
```

### Root Cause
The `McpMessage` class was serializing ALL fields to JSON, even null ones. This resulted in response messages like:
```json
{
  "id": "0",
  "method": null,
  "params": null,
  "result": {...},
  "error": null,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0"
}
```

According to JSON-RPC 2.0 specification, responses should ONLY contain:
- `jsonrpc`: "2.0"
- `id`: matching the request ID  
- Either `result` (success) OR `error` (failure)

## Fix Applied

### File Modified
`src/main/java/com/korshak/mcpserver/model/McpMessage.java`

### Changes Made
1. Added Jackson import: `import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonInclude;`
2. Added class annotation: `@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)`

### Result
Now the server will send properly formatted JSON-RPC responses:

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "0", 
  "result": {
    "capabilities": {"tools": {}},
    "serverInfo": {"name": "Knowledge Store MCP Server", "version": "1.0.0"},
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05"
  }
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32601,
    "message": "Method not found"
  }
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Run `FINAL-FIX.bat` to rebuild the project
2. Test the stdin server with Claude desktop
3. Verify that the "Unrecognized key(s)" error no longer occurs

## Technical Details
The `@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_NULL)` annotation tells Jackson to exclude any fields that are `null` when serializing to JSON. This ensures:

- Response messages don't include `method` or `params` fields (which are null)
- Success responses don't include the `error` field (which is null)  
- Error responses don't include the `result` field (which is null)
- Only relevant fields are serialized, creating valid JSON-RPC 2.0 messages

This fix maintains full compatibility with both request parsing and response generation while ensuring strict compliance with the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification.
