Meeting Notes - MCP Server Development
======================================

Date: January 2025
Attendees: Development Team
Topic: Knowledge Server Enhancement

Key Decisions:
- Implement metadata-enhanced file management
- Support for EPUB and DjVu formats
- Dual transport: WebSocket and stdin/stdout
- Package migration to com.korshak namespace

Action Items:
1. Complete EPUB text extraction implementation
2. Add DjVu support with external tool integration  
3. Create comprehensive test suite
4. Document Claude Desktop integration steps
5. Prepare for user testing phase

Technical Notes:
- Apache Tika provides good fallback for unknown formats
- JSoup library excellent for HTML parsing in EPUB files
- DjVuLibre tools required for optimal DjVu text extraction
- Spring Boot 3.x requires Jakarta annotations (not javax)

Next Steps:
- Deploy to test environment
- Conduct Claude Desktop integration testing
- Gather user feedback on file format support
- Plan additional format support (CBR/CBZ comics?)

Issues Resolved:
- Fixed Spring Boot configuration conflicts
- Resolved PDFBox version compatibility 
- Completed package namespace migration
- Added proper error handling for missing tools
